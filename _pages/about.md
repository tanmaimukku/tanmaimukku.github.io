# About Me

Welcome to my personal portfolio! I'm excited to share a bit about myself, my passions, and my work.

## Introduction

Hello! My name is Tanmai Mukku, and I am a Master's student in Computer Science at Arizona State University with a GPA of 4.22/4.00. I hold a B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering from the International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, with a GPA of 8.0/10.0. I have a strong background in backend engineering, healthcare information systems, and a keen interest in artificial intelligence and machine learning.

## My Journey

My journey in the tech world started with a fascination for how things work. Over the years, I've honed my skills in various programming languages and frameworks. My tech stack includes:

- **Languages and Databases**: Java, Python, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, Cassandra, Kafka
- **Frameworks and Libraries**: Spring Boot, Node.js, OAuth2, JWT
- **Developer Tools**: Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Gitlab CI, JUnit, Prometheus, Grafana, AWS (EC2, S3, ECS, EKS, Lambda)
- **Methodologies**: RESTful APIs, Microservices Architecture, Object-Oriented Design, Agile SDLC, Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD), Test Driven Development (TDD)

## Projects and Achievements

I've worked on a variety of projects, including a Knowledge Representation and Reasoning project for assigning referees to insurance cases using Answer Set Programming (ASP), and a machine learning project for a multimodal movie recommendation system. One of my notable achievements is training a collaborative filtering model using matrix factorization on the Goodreads dataset, achieving 0.771 RMSE with XGBoost on 80-20 splits.
