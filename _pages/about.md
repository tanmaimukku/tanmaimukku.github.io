## Projects and Achievements

I've worked on a variety of projects, including a Knowledge Representation and Reasoning project for assigning referees to insurance cases using Answer Set Programming (ASP), and a machine learning project for a multimodal movie recommendation system. One of my notable achievements is training a collaborative filtering model using matrix factorization on the Goodreads dataset, achieving 0.771 RMSE with XGBoost on 80-20 splits.
